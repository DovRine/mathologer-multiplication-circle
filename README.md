### This project was inspired by Mathologer's YouTube video:

### Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics


This is a visualization of the multiplication tables, which produces some very beautiful patterns. 

For a complete explanation, please watch the video. It's only 13:37 minutes long.

I wanted to create a quick project with native javascript modules, so this seemed like a good choice. 
It's still pretty rough around the edges, but I'm happy with it so far.

Since this project uses modules you will need some kind of server to run it or you willll see 
CORS errors in the console. https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server and the development 
servers built into PHP and python will all work.

I hope you enjoy it.
